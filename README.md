wireless tools for wireless administration 

While studying for the my CWNA the first few chapters add a bit of math and...I was lazy and didn't want to do it so I 
wrote a small python file to do the math for me. 

### RFMath.py

Allows the user to calculate dBm or mW, estimate with the rules of 10s and 3s, and calculate the height of an antenna


### Wireless_network.py

This is a small script that takes the default Kismet.netxml and parses through it. Limited options include SSID details, 
BSSID, Frequency, Channel, Carrier, and Encoding. 

File will ask for the path/to/file  and then add the networks found allowing you to search for the above mentioned details.


## To Run

Simply run the main.py file or if you want the just run one of the files scroll to the bottom and uncomment out the main function.
